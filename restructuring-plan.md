# Research Paper Restructuring Plan: AgentSight

## Current State Analysis

The paper presents AgentSight, a system-level observability framework for AI agents using eBPF. While the technical content is strong, the structure needs refinement to meet formal research paper standards.

## Proposed Restructuring

  - Streaming framework architecture
  - Correlation engine algorithm (add pseudocode)
  - Semantic analysis components
- **Section 5.3: Engineering Challenges**
  - TLS interception details

### 7. **Future Work**
- **Short-term**: Immediate engineering improvements
- **Medium-term**: Research extensions
- **Long-term**: Vision for agent observability field

### 8. **Conclusion**
- Concise summary of contributions
- Impact statement
- Call to action for community

## Additional Improvements

### Technical Writing
1. **Consistency**: Standardize terminology (e.g., "AI agent" vs "agent")
2. **Precision**: Replace vague terms with specific metrics
3. **Citations**: Add more related work citations (aim for 40-50 references)
4. **Figures**: Convert ASCII diagrams to proper figures
5. **Algorithms**: Add pseudocode for key algorithms

### Evaluation Enhancements
1. **Baselines**: Compare against at least 2 existing solutions
2. **Workload diversity**: Add more agent frameworks to evaluation
3. **Statistical rigor**: Include error bars, confidence intervals
4. **Reproducibility**: Add detailed reproduction instructions

### Missing Elements
1. **Threat model**: Formal definition of adversary capabilities
2. **Privacy analysis**: Data retention, PII handling
3. **Deployment guide**: Production considerations
4. **API documentation**: Key interfaces and extensibility

### Paper Flow
1. **Narrative arc**: Problem → Insight → Solution → Validation
2. **Transitions**: Smooth connections between sections
3. **Redundancy**: Remove repetitive content between sections
4. **Balance**: Ensure each section has appropriate depth

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Structural Changes (Week 1)
- Reorganize sections according to plan
- Split background and motivation
- Consolidate related content

### Phase 2: Content Enhancement (Week 2)
- Expand evaluation section

- Improve figure quality

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 3)
- Technical writing improvements
- Citation additions
- Final review and editing

## Target Venues

Consider submission to:
1. **OSDI/SOSP**: Systems focus, emphasize performance and design
2. **Security conferences** (USENIX Security, IEEE S&P): Emphasize threat detection
3. **AI/ML Systems** (MLSys, SysML): Focus on AI-specific challenges
4. **Cloud/Operations** (NSDI, EuroSys): Emphasize production deployment

## Key Success Metrics

The restructured paper should:
1. Clearly articulate the unique observability challenges of AI agents
2. Present boundary tracing as a novel, principled approach
3. Demonstrate comprehensive evaluation with strong baselines
4. Provide reproducible results and open-source artifacts
5. Inspire future research in AI agent observability
